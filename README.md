# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import numpy module as np to use the built-in function for calcluating the distance between the two points.
### Step 2: 
Get the x1 and x2 values from the user to calculate the distance between the two points.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4: 
Print the distance between the two points in two decimal places by {:.2f} format.
### Step 5: 
End the program.

### PROGRAM:
  
```python
#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))

```

### OUTPUT:
